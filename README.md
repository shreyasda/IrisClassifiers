# EM Algorithm and K-means-clustering
Classification of Iris dataset using K-means clustering. This was created as a part of the mini project for the elective course Introduction To Machine Learning (IS6E103).

The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is a widely used machine learning algorithm for estimating the parameters of probabilistic models with latent variables. It is an iterative algorithm that alternates between two steps: the E-step (Expectation step) and the M-step (Maximization step).

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups or clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm aims to find K number of centroids in the data, where K is a predefined parameter specified by the user.

Accuracies of the models:
EM Algorithm Accuracy: 0.9666666666666667
K-means Clustering Accuracy: 0.8933333333333333
